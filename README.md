# A Platform game

## Description

A minimalist game consisting of a player(black box) which is to be navigated around using left and right arrow keys and jump using up key. The task is to collect all the coins(yellow boxes) and avoid lava(red boxes). Some levels have monsters (cyan) that can be killed by jumping on top of them.
Good luck!
